I was able to get hands-on #4 working by...

creating a new repo sayit (totally different name than quote)

cloning that repo in higher-level directory than go-project

creating the sayanything.go module, with it's own go.mod file,
...referencing github.com/imattf/sayit 


creating another peer directory "temp01" with the main.go inside of it, 
...that calls the sayit module

now gonna try w/ quotes in same level directory as sayit,
...and this one worked. I had to do a go get github.com/imattf/quotes,
...which pulled down updated version of quotes v0.1.1
...yay!!!

now gonna try in go-project
